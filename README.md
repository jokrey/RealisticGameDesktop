# RealisticGame

A Desktop Implementation of a small, original 2d game.

It features a rather simple minded AI, you can play against.

Requires the "jokrey.utilities.animation" package from AnimationEngine(another repository) to build

FYI: The Realistic Part or the name is meant to be a joke. A more fitting name would be:

"Oval's shooting Oval's, with Oval's and there is Lightsabers"

How to play:
  Build this yourself.
  Or download the app. (maybe a bit easier)
