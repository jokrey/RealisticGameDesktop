# RealisticGame

A Desktop Implementation of a small, original 2d game.
It is easily extendable. If you build a new cool map(extending RealisticMap) let me know.

### Installing

* Clone the repository with the 'git clone' command.
(Additionally there are a number of dependencies on the AnimationEngine repository, so clone that into the path also)
* Download one of the releases (functionality maybe to broad or too narrow)

## Features

 * A 2D jump, run and shoot environment fitting the screen
 * Multiple Maps
 * Multiple Weapons
 * Teleporters
 * PowerUp Items
 * Armor
 * Optionally Multiple Players
 * Optionally a simple AI to play against (may not be able to handle every imaginable map).

## Usage

See the [example package](src/jokrey/utililities/swing/text_editor/example) for simple, runnable examples of most use cases

## Acknowledgments

The Realistic Part or the name is meant to be a joke. A more fitting name would be:
"Oval's shooting Oval's, with Oval's and there is light(ish) swords and teleporters maybe"
